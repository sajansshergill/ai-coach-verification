# Video Sales Letter: AI Coach Verification & Sales Assistant

**Duration:** ~6–7 minutes  
**Format:** Screen recording + voiceover  
**Audience:** Coaching platforms, marketplaces, directories, SaaS founders

---

## Opening Hook (0:00–0:30)

**[Screen: Clean landing page → subtle motion → onboarding UI]**

"If you run a coaching platform or marketplace, there's a good chance verification is quietly slowing you down.

Manual credential reviews take time.

Long onboarding forms cause drop-offs.

And as your platform grows, verification becomes harder to scale without sacrificing quality.

Over the next few minutes, I'll show you a system designed to assist with coach onboarding and verification, reduce operational overhead, and help platforms move faster — without removing human control.

This is the AI Coach Verification & Sales Assistant."

---

## The Core Problem (0:30–1:30)

**[Screen: Simple diagrams — forms → delays → drop-offs]**

"Most coaching platforms run into the same challenges:

**First, verification is manual and time-intensive.**

Teams spend hours reviewing documents, links, and credentials for each coach.

**Second, onboarding feels transactional instead of supportive.**

Coaches are asked to fill long forms without guidance, and many abandon the process halfway through.

**Third, verification quality becomes inconsistent.**

Different reviewers interpret standards differently, which leads to uneven outcomes.

**And finally, verification doesn't scale.**

As more coaches apply, operational load increases linearly.

**The result is simple:**

platforms spend more time reviewing than growing — and quality coaches get stuck in the process."

---

## What This System Does (1:30–2:00)

**[Screen: Transition to clean product UI]**

"This system was built to assist — not replace — your verification process.

**It helps coaches:**
• Understand what's required
• Submit credentials more completely
• Prepare profiles that are review-ready

**And it helps your team:**
• Standardize verification inputs
• Reduce back-and-forth
• Spend time only where human judgment matters

**Final decisions always remain with humans.**"

---

## AI Transparency Statement (2:00–2:15)

**[Screen: Simple text slide]**

"Important note:

This system uses AI to assist with onboarding, information collection, and readiness assessment.

**The AI does not approve or reject coaches.**

All verification outcomes are determined by human reviewers.

This ensures accuracy, fairness, and compliance — while significantly reducing manual workload."

---

## Live Walkthrough: Coach Experience (2:15–3:15)

**[Screen: Coach onboarding flow]**

"Here's what the coach experiences.

Instead of a long static form, onboarding becomes a guided, conversational process.

**Coaches are walked step-by-step through:**
• Their coaching focus and experience
• Certifications or training
• Professional presence (website, LinkedIn)
• Testimonials or proof of work
• Optional payment verification

**File uploads are supported, instructions are clear, and alternatives are suggested if something is missing.**

This approach helps coaches complete onboarding with confidence — not confusion."

---

## AI-Assisted Verification Flow (3:15–4:15)

**[Screen: AI chat interface]**

"Once credentials are submitted, the AI assists by reviewing completeness and structure.

**It:**
• Confirms received information
• Identifies missing or weak signals
• Suggests acceptable alternatives
• Explains verification tiers clearly

If a coach aims for a higher tier but lacks one requirement, the system explains what's missing — instead of silently blocking progress.

Throughout this process, the AI is supportive, professional, and transparent.

**Again — it assists, it does not decide.**"

---

## Trust Profile Summary Generation (4:15–4:45)

**[Screen: Generated summary view]**

"After onboarding, the system generates a structured trust profile summary.

**This includes:**
• Coaching niche and experience
• Verified credentials
• External credibility signals
• Areas that could be strengthened

What normally requires manual synthesis is prepared automatically — consistently and clearly — for human review.

**Every coach profile follows the same quality standard.**"

---

## Admin & Reviewer View (4:45–5:30)

**[Screen: Admin dashboard]**

"From the platform side, everything is centralized.

**Reviewers see:**
• Coach status at a glance
• Submitted credentials
• AI-generated summaries
• Conversation history

This allows teams to move faster, focus on edge cases, and maintain consistent standards as volume grows.

**Platforms using AI-assisted onboarding often report significant reductions in review time, while improving overall profile quality.**"

---

## Why This Matters (5:30–6:00)

**[Screen: Simple bullet list]**

"This system changes verification from a bottleneck into a support layer.

**Platforms typically see:**
• Higher onboarding completion
• More consistent coach profiles
• Less manual back-and-forth
• Better use of human review time

**The AI doesn't replace trust — it helps structure it.**"
