## Coach: Sarah Chen - Pro Tier Verification

### Opening

**AI:**
Hi Sarah Chen! 👋 Welcome to CoachMarket. I'm here to help you get verified and set up your profile so you can start receiving qualified leads.

**Why verification matters:**
Verified coaches get:
- Higher visibility in search results
- Better quality leads
- Increased trust from potential clients
- Access to premium features

**Verification Tiers:**
- **Basic** (Minimum requirements) - Quick approval, basic visibility
- **Pro** (Enhanced verification) - Higher visibility, featured listings, priority support
- **Premium** (Full verification) - Maximum visibility, premium leads, dedicated support

Let's get started! Which tier interests you? Or would you like me to explain the differences first?

**Coach:**
I'd like to go for Pro tier. What do I need?

### Collecting Certifications

**AI:**
Great choice! Pro tier gives you higher visibility and better leads. Let's get you verified.

First, what coaching certifications or training programs have you completed? You can list them here, or upload certificates if you have them.

**Coach:**
I'm ICF certified, and I have an Executive Coaching Certificate from the Institute of Executive Coaching.

**AI:**
Excellent! ✅ I've noted:
- ICF Certified
- Executive Coaching Certificate from Institute of Executive Coaching

Do you have the certification dates? That helps build credibility.

**Coach:**
ICF was 2020, and the Executive Coaching Certificate was 2019.

**AI:**
Perfect! ✅ I've recorded your certifications. Next, let's talk about your coaching experience.

### Collecting Experience

**AI:**
How long have you been coaching? Tell me about your coaching background and any notable clients or results.

**Coach:**
I've been coaching for about 5 years. I specialize in executive coaching for tech leaders, and I've worked with VPs and C-level executives at companies like Google, Microsoft, and various startups.

**AI:**
That's impressive! ✅ I've recorded:
- 5 years of experience
- Specialization: Executive coaching for tech leaders
- Notable clients: VPs and C-level executives at major tech companies

Great background! Now, let's verify your professional presence.

### Collecting Website/Social

**AI:**
For Pro tier verification, we need either a professional website or LinkedIn profile with a coaching focus. Do you have either of these?

**Coach:**
Yes, I have a website at sarahchencoaching.com, and my LinkedIn is linkedin.com/in/sarahchencoaching.

**AI:**
Perfect! I can see your website is active and coaching-focused. ✅ I've verified:
- Website: sarahchencoaching.com
- LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/sarahchencoaching

Both look professional and relevant. Now, for social proof—do you have client testimonials or reviews?

---

### Collecting Testimonials

**Coach:**
Yes, I have a few testimonials. Should I paste them here?

**AI:**
Yes, please! You can paste them here or share links if they're public. Testimonials with specific results are most powerful.

**Coach:**
Here are a few:

"Sarah helped me transition from VP to C-level at a Fortune 500 company. Her guidance on executive presence and strategic thinking was invaluable. Within 6 months of working with her, I secured the CEO role I was targeting."

- John Smith, CEO at TechCorp

"I've worked with several coaches, but Sarah's structured approach and deep understanding of tech leadership challenges made all the difference. She helped me increase my confidence in presenting to the board by 40%, and I got promoted to CTO within a year."

- Maria Lopez, CTO at StartupX

**AI:**
These are fantastic testimonials! ✅ They're specific, include results, and show clear value. I've recorded 2 testimonials for your Pro tier verification.

Just one more thing for Pro tier—do you have payment verification? A screenshot of a payment from a client (with personal info blurred) or a link to a public review platform works.

**Coach:**
I can share a screenshot from Stripe if that works?

**AI:**
Perfect! Stripe screenshots work great. Just make sure any personal information (like full names, addresses) is blurred out for privacy. You can upload it here.

**Coach:**
